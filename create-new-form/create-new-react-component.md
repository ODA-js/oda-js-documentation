# Create new react component

1. Go to `/beAdmin/src/components` folder 
2. Create new folder and and name it as your component names \(for example, `sample_component`\). 
3. Create in this folder file `index.js` and open it with your favorite editor. 
4. This is the main file of your component. You can describe the component there or import it from the other file. Try to decomposite a large component into smaller parts. Place the parts in the same folder and use it in the main component with `import` keyword. Use already created components from `/beAdmin/src/controls`, too.

**Note:** If your component has a composite name, please use `_` as a separator. The name of component should be in the lower case.
