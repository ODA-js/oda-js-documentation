#Controls 

Controls place in `/beAdmin/src/controls` folder. You will need controls if you want to create the input field, panel, modal window or something else and if you don't want to create it from scratch. 
It's recommended to use created controls because they configured, designed, debugged and ready to work. 
Before you create your own component for input data, pop-up or a similar functions, make sure that it isn't in `controls` folder.
