# Understanding GraphQl Schema

The name of the entity is singular always. If the name of the entity is **plural**, it will be transformed to **singular**. 

The name of the entity is used for the generation of [mutations](/development-issues/understanding-graphql-schema/generate-mutations/mutations-for-entity.md) and [queries](/development-issues/understanding-graphql-schema/queries.md) for every entity.
