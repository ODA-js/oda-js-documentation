# Create new react component

1. Go to `/beAdmin/src/components` folder; 
2. Create new folder and name it as your component \(for example, `sample_component`\);
3. Create file `index.js`in this folder and open it with your preferred editor. 

This is the main file of your component. You can describe the component there or import it from the other file. Try to decomposite a large component into smaller parts. Place the parts in the same folder and use them in the main component with `import` keyword. Use already created components from `/beAdmin/src/controls`, too.

You can view your component with the fake data via [React Storybook](/development-issues/create-new-form/create-new-react-component/storybook.md).

**Note:** If your component has a composite name, please use `"`\_`"` as a separator. The name of component should be in the lower case.
