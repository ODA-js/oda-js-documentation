# Data layer

Data layer is build using GraphQL. We use Facebook's Relay framework as transport layer for GraphQL.

As far as React is a UI-framework to build single page appilcation, it is renders server data on the client, but we can also can use server side rendering engine for every client page and this feature can be configured differently for any route in the system. This techinque is called server-side render (SSR). SSR is very usefull for SEO optimization.
