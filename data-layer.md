# Data layer

Data layer is build using GraphQL. We use Facebook Relay framework as transportlayer for GraphQL.

As far as React is a UI-framework to build single page appilcation, it isrenders server data on the client, but we can also can use server side renderingengine for every client page and this feature can be configured differentlyfor any route in the system. This techinque is called server-side render \(SSR\).SSR is very usefull for SEO optimization.
