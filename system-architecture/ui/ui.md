# UI

As far as React is a UI-framework to build single page appilcation, it is renders server data on the client, but we can also can use server side rendering engine for every client page and this feature can be configured differently for any route in the system. This techinque is called server-side render \(SSR\). SSR is very usefull for SEO optimization.

We've used beAdmin theme for bootstrap and building reusable component for the appliation to provide true React UIX.

We use `react-bootstrap` library. Every form reuse existing component-base to make the UI feel consistent with the selected theme.
