# NodeJS installation

1. Need to check if NodeJS installed on your PC and which version. We need version 7 or above.<br>Open terminal window and run command:<br> `node --version`                                                                                                 

   ```
    Note: If you get message that NodeJS is not installed, you should install it.
   ```

2. NodeJS installation. <br> Open terminal window and run command:<br> `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.2/install.sh | bash` <br>

   ```
    Note: If you get message "command not found" after running the install script, you system may not have a [.bash_profile file] where the command is set up.Simply create one with touch ~/.bash_profile and run the install script again.
   ```
Then run terminal window:<br>`nvm install v7`<br> `nvm use v7`
