# NodeJS installation

1. Check if NodeJS installed on your PC and which version. <br>
**We need version 7 or above**.<br> 
a) Open terminal window; <br> 
b) Run command:<br> `node --version`<br>
c) If you see output **"v.7.3.0"** or **"v.7.5.0"** in terminal, this means that NodeJS with fresh enough version is installed in your system. You can skip steps 2 and 3 and go next to [installation of MongoDB](/install-mongodb.md).</br>
d) If you see output **"The program 'node' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing: sudo apt install node"** in terminal, this means that NodeJS is not installed in your system. Please, proceed with installation.<br>                                       
2. Install Node Version Manager (NVM). <br> 
1) Open terminal window; <br> 
2) Run command:<br>`curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.2/install.sh | bash` <br>
`Note:` If you get message "command not found" after running the install script, you system may not have a [.bash_profile file] where the command is set up.Simply create one with touch ~/.bash_profile and run the install script again.
3. Then open run terminal window and run command for install Node Version Manager(NVM):<br>`nvm install v7`<br> `nvm use v7`
