# Create a new form 

For building the form with databinding and with full functionality we need: 


* Create a form component in `beAdmin/src/components/` folder. We need use the existing controls from `beAdmin/src/controls/` folder 
* Create a page for our form in `beAdmin/src/pages/` folder
* Add queries for get data in `beAdmin/src/queries/` folder
* Describe required mutations in `beAdmin/src/mutations/` folder 
* Create a new route in `beAdmin/src/routes.js`
