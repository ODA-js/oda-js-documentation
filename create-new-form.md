# Create new form 

For building form with databinding and with full functionality we need: 

* Create new route in `beAdmin/src/routes.js`
* Create form component in `beAdmin/src/components/` folder. We need use existing controls from `beAdmin/src/controls/` folder 
* Create page for our form in `beAdmin/src/pages/` folder
* Add queries for get data in `beAdmin/src/queries/` folder
* Describe the required mutations in `beAdmin/src/mutations/` folder
